# Using javascript to store & retrieve LocalStorage & a HTML form with array
Example on how to use selectors to store and retrieve from localStorage

In this example, we create a new student object called studentA and store it into localStorage. 
Our localStorage key -> 'studentA'

We are going to use an array to store multiple objects at once and JSON.stringify to our localStorage

After storing, we simply retrieve and display into our HTML code using selectors

Our object consist of 4 properties
- student id
- student name
- student class
- created date (automated)
